# Contributing to the project

**Warning**: Project is still not stable - there will be plenty of internal API changes required in order to ensure compatability and smoother experience for users

## Quick start

To try and use the development version

```bash
# Go build command would create the binary of the CLI Tool
# It would generate a binary called tasker
go build

./tasker
```
